In a multitasking operating system, such as Linux, the {CPU} has to switch between multiple processes or threads in order to keep the system running smoothly. This is necessary because each {CPU} core without hyperthreading can only execute one process or thread at a time. If there are many processes or threads running simultaneously, and very few {CPU} cores available to handle them, the system is forced to make more context switches to balance the {CPU} resources among them.},
